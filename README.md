Implementation of the Conway's Game of Life

# Project roadmap
Implement:
- All [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules)
- Change the size of the field
- Generation of a random field
- Manual filling of the field
- Cell color selection
- Mixing the colors of the cells (if a new cell is formed by multi-colored cells, then the new cell must be a mixture of all parent ones) 
- Change random number distributions generators
